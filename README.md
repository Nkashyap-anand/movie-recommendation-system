# movie-recommendation-system
# This is python based recommendation system for movie recommendations 
# currently it is command line based
# We use IMDB’s weighted rating formula to sort movies on their popularity. For content-based learning we convert movies into vectors and then use “cosine similarity” to find similar movies. Python provide a wide range tools to work with recommendation systems. In our system use Surprise package. This package provides various algorithms, we use SVD (Singular value decomposition) to build a hybrid system.
#Our datasets consist of more than 26million ratings and 750thousands tag applications applied to more than 45,000 movies.
